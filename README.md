#  Wine Quality Prediction - ML Project

This machine learning project predicts wine quality using a Random Forest classifier. It combines red and white wine datasets and follows a modular, production-ready structure.

##  Project Structure


## 📊 Dataset

- [`winequality-red.csv`](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/)
- [`winequality-white.csv`](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/)

## 🛠️ Features

- Merges red & white wine datasets
- Preprocessing (label encoding, scaling)
- Model training (Random Forest)
- Evaluation (Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix)
- Auto-generated evaluation report in `docs/`
